# Ebay_OpenAI_API
This project focuses on practicing API integrations by retrieving top-viewed products from different technology categories using the eBay API. The data is stored in a DataFrame, and the OpenAI API is then used to compare and analyze average prices across these products. The project highlights the process of fetching, storing, and analyzing data from multiple APIs.
